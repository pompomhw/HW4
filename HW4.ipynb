    "###  analysis of the several factors on the passing grade\n",
    "\n",
    "1. school type: Charter schools showed the much better overall passing % (95% vs. 73%)\n",
    "especially, there was a big difference in math area (94% vs.66%)\n",
    "2. school size: Definitely, smaller size of school outperformed the larger size of school \n",
    "such as 94% vs 76%. Overall, there was no difference in the performance between small and the meium size of school, showing that large size above 2.000 students mad a big difference in their performance.\n",
    "3. The charter school all seem to have a smaller size under 2000, while the district schools all show big size of the students as 2000-5000. Similarly, all the 5 top school were charter schools meanwhile all the bottom 5 schools were district schools.\n",
    "4. budget per student: Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to affect the students' performance, at all.\n",
    "5, Grade (9-12th): The grade doesn't sesem to ahve any effect on the performance. Rather, thier average score was swayed by individual school's atmosphere. Especially, math score was affected greatly than reading. \n"
